1. Mercury
Temperature: Mercury experiences the most extreme temperature differences in the Solar System. Daytime temperatures can reach up to 427°C, hot enough to melt lead, while nighttime temperatures drop to −173°C due to the absence of an atmosphere to retain heat.
Weather & Climate: Mercury has almost no atmosphere, so there is no wind, rain, or weather activity.
Rocks: The surface is covered with hard silicate rocks and is heavily cratered, resembling the Moon.
Gravity: About 0.38 times Earth’s gravity. You would feel extremely light, able to jump about three times higher than on Earth.
Fun Fact: Although Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, it is not the hottest planet. It is also slowly shrinking over time as its iron core cools, partly because it lacks an atmosphere to retain heat.

2. Venus
Temperature: Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System, with a constant surface temperature of around 464°C, both day and night.
Weather & Climate: Extremely harsh, with thick clouds and acid rain composed of sulfuric acid.
Rocks: The surface consists mainly of volcanic basalt, with thousands of volcanoes, many of which are still active.
Gravity: About 0.91 times Earth’s gravity, so your body would feel almost the same as on Earth.
Fun Fact: On Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east because the planet rotates in the opposite direction of most other planets.

3. The Moon
Temperature: Ranges from −173°C at night to 127°C during the day.
Weather & Climate: Completely silent and motionless—there is no wind, no clouds, and no sound, as there is no atmosphere to transmit sound waves.
Rocks: The surface is covered by a thick layer of rocky dust called regolith, formed by billions of years of meteorite impacts.
Gravity: Extremely weak, only about 0.17 times Earth’s gravity (approximately one-sixth). You could lift a rock the size of a refrigerator with ease.
Fun Fact: Astronaut footprints left more than 50 years ago remain perfectly preserved because there is no wind to erase them.

4. Mars
Temperature: Very cold, with an average temperature of about −62°C. On the warmest days near the equator, temperatures may reach 20°C, but drop sharply at night.
Weather & Climate: Mars frequently experiences massive red dust storms that can last for weeks. Snow occasionally falls, but it is made of frozen carbon dioxide (CO₂).
Rocks: Rich in iron-bearing basalt rocks. When oxidized (rusted), they produce the planet’s distinctive red dust.
Gravity: About 0.38 times Earth’s gravity. You could throw a ball three times farther than on Earth.
Fun Fact: Unlike Earth’s red sunsets, Mars features blue sunsets, caused by fine dust particles scattering sunlight in the thin atmosphere.

5. Jupiter
Temperature: Extremely cold in the upper cloud layers, averaging around −145°C.
Weather & Climate: A massive gas giant with violent storms and lightning. The Great Red Spot is a giant storm that has been raging for over 300 years.
Gravity: Very strong, about 2.53 times Earth’s gravity. If you weighed 50 kg on Earth, you would feel like you weighed 126 kg on Jupiter, making movement extremely difficult.
Fun Fact: Jupiter’s enormous gravity helps deflect asteroids and comets, protecting inner planets such as Earth from frequent impacts.

6. Saturn
Temperature: Averages around −178°C.
Weather & Climate: Features extremely powerful winds, faster than jet aircraft. At the north pole, there is a mysterious hexagon-shaped storm that never disappears.
Gravity: Slightly stronger than Earth’s, about 1.07 times Earth’s gravity, making you feel just a little heavier.
Fun Fact: If a giant bathtub existed, Saturn would float on water because its average density is lower than that of water.

7. Uranus
Temperature: The coldest planet in the Solar System, with temperatures dropping to −224°C.
Weather & Climate: Its atmosphere is rich in methane, giving the planet a pale blue color. Winds are strong and extremely cold.
Rocks: Uranus has no solid rocky surface. It is composed mainly of compressed “ice” (a mixture of water, methane, and ammonia).
Gravity: Slightly weaker than Earth’s, about 0.89 times Earth’s gravity.
Fun Fact: Uranus rotates on its side, appearing to roll along its orbit, like a ball rolling across the floor.

8. Neptune
Temperature: Extremely cold, averaging around −214°C.
Weather & Climate: Home to the strongest winds in the Solar System, reaching speeds of up to 2,000 km/h, faster than the speed of sound.
Rocks: Similar to Uranus, Neptune is an ice giant with a small rocky core.
Gravity: Slightly stronger than Earth’s, about 1.14 times Earth’s gravity, making movement feel heavier.
Fun Fact: Deep inside Neptune, immense pressure may potentially create diamond rain, with diamonds falling toward the planet’s core.
